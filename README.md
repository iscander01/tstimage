   ```bash
   cd crud-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

## Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Header.tsx          # App header with add button
│   ├── UserList.tsx        # Table displaying all users
│   ├── UserForm.tsx        # Modal form for create/edit
│   └── *.css              # Component-specific styles
├── services/
│   └── userService.ts      # Data layer with localStorage
├── types/

├── App.tsx                # Main application component
└── index.tsx              # Application entry point
```

## Usage

### Adding a User
1. Click the "+ Add New User" button in the header
2. Fill in the required fields (name, email, phone)
3. Click "Create" to save the user

### Editing a User
1. Click the edit button (✏️) next to any user in the table
2. Modify the information in the form
3. Click "Update" to save changes

### Deleting a User
1. Click the delete button (🗑️) next to any user
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog

## Data Persistence

All user data is automatically saved to the browser's localStorage. This means:
- Data persists between browser sessions
- No server required for basic functionality
- Data is stored locally on the user's device

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)

## Customization

### Adding New Fields
1. Update the `User` interface in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Modify the `UserForm` component to include the new field
3. Update the `UserList` component to display the new field
4. Adjust the service methods if needed

### Styling
- Component-specific styles are in separate `.css` files
- Global styles are in `App.css`
- The app uses a modern color scheme that can be easily customized

## Browser Support

This application works in all modern browsers that support:
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- localStorage API
- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- CSS animations

## Future Enhancements
